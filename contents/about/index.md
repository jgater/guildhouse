##About me##

Husband, sysadmin, developer, designer, model painter, gamer. I also cook - sometimes! Currently working in the wonderful North Dorset English countryside as a senior systems manager and sometimes javascript coder.

##About the blog##

I wanted a place to host my projects, photos and other stuff. Thanks for visiting!

This is a static blog site created using the flexible node.js-powered Wintersmith site builder, with additional client-side CSS and Javascript from Foundation 4 and others. All glued together with my own template and code. Projects used include:

* [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) (MIT)
* [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (MIT)
* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) (MIT)
* [MomentJS](http://momentjs.com/) (MIT)
* [Iconic font](http://www.somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/) (SIL open font)
* [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) (MIT for non-commercial use)
* and [Snowboot](https://github.com/ndhu/snowboot-wintersmith-templates) was inspiration for the Tags code.

Copyright for the above lies with their respective authors, and are used here under their licence terms.

A version of this site - without all the articles, and with basic Foundation styling etc - suitable for bootstrapping your own Foundation/Wintersmith blog is at [Winter Foundations](https://github.com/jgater/winter-foundations)

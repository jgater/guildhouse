Hello world. After many years, getting back into the blogging game. Now I have something to post. 

But I need to write that stuff first. So this is an intervening post, to well, tide you over.

<span class="more"></span>

Looking at the logs, looks like there's still people using it for the avalon bits after the site being abandoned by me for so long - including the long hiatus when I'd lost the logins and the email account to get into it to pay the charges and re-enable the site. Wow. Colour me surprised. I thought this place would be long un-used and suitable to redo as virgin territory!

So guess I'll be fixing up those sections to work again properly too, after all. Some *serious* updates needed there - including modifying my new site design to include links!

Planning to keep and fixup these areas at least:

+ [Avalon area, including forum](/avalon)
+ [Avalon wiki](/ewiki)


But for the time being....
Oh look - kittens! In boxes! Click for more!

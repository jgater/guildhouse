My friends and I have taken on a joint challenge for May - each of five of us is painting a Games Workshop 28mm miniature, a Gaunt's Ghost of Dan Abnett's books. My randomly assigned figure was Brin Milo.

I've relocated to another room - something about being able to use the dining table for dinner with guests, I think. Nice afternoon sun to paint with though! So, battle dress first.

		<blockquote>And this is why I love ink washes. A final wash with slightly watered down AP strong tone brings the final colour much closer back to black and blends the layers together for a much more subtle effect. They cover up so many sins!</blockquote>

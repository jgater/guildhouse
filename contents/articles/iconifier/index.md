Finally got round to making a nicer favicon that fits with the theme better - the little logo that shows up in tabs and bookmarks.

Just a quick mention for [iconifier.net](http://www.iconifier.net) - there are so many dreadful favicon generators out there, it was really nice to find this one that does a great job of taking an image file and auto-generating the multisize favicon.ico and all the oddball sized apple touch icons the various iDevices use for shortcuts and things. Simple, free, does what it says on the tin and saved me a bunch of legwork. Nice.
